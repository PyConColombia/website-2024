              <h1>Why should you speak at PyCon Colombia 2024?</h1>
              <br />
              <p>
                We strongly believe that if you have something you are really passionate about and
                you want to spread the word, you should craft a talk and do it! but, if that's not
                enough to convince you, here is the list of perks you get by becoming a PyCon
                Colombia 2024 speaker:
              </p>
              <br />
              <ul>
                <li>Free full conference pass: Gives you access to all talks and workshops.</li>
                <li>Access to Speaker dinner: Dinner that includes keynotes speakers, sponsors, speakers and
                organizers, fully paid by the conference.</li>

                <li>The opportunity to positively impact the lives of over 600 attendees.</li>
              </ul>
              <h1>Our Selection Process</h1>
              <br />
              <p>
                In order to create the most valuable talks and workshops line-up for the conference
                we follow this process:
              </p>
              <br />
              <ol>
                <li>
                  All proposals reviews are anonymized, that way we avoid the bias towards the
                  submitter.
                </li>
                <li>All proposals are reviewed and voted by our Reviewers Team.</li>
                <li>
                  The best-rated proposals are de-anonymized to review the speaker's profile, this
                  is made by the PyCon Colombia's Talks Committee.
                </li>
                <li>The Committee decides the final line-up.</li>
              </ol>
              <br />
              <p>
                We are really excited to get a lot more excellent submissions than we have speaking
                slots. This process helps us to get the best proposals by trying to avoid the bias
                to the speaker profile.
              </p>
              <br />
              <h1>Talks</h1>
              <br />
              <p>
                This is a space of 40 minutes (Including Q & A, commonly distributed in 30 minutes
                for talk, 10 minutes for questions). if which you can speak of any subject (Not only
                Python-centric themes) using a slide deck and live demos if you wish
              </p>
              <br />
              <h1>Talk Videos</h1>
              <br />
              <p>
                We will record the talks and upload them to our YouTube channel, this includes a
                screen recording of the speaker's slide deck, live demos, and speaker's in-person
                activity. This benefits all the members of the Python community who can't make it to
                PyCon Colombia. By submitting your proposal to PyCon Colombia, you agree to give us
                permission to record, edit and release audio and/or video of your presentation. If
                you aren't ok with this, please let us know and we will work this out.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Also, since you own your slide deck, we would like to ask you to do them under an
                open-source license like Creative Commons
